    "In Seattle, Terry stops refer to brief stops and detentions by police officers based on a reasonable suspicion that a person may be involved in criminal activity. The term originates from the U.S. Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio (1968), which established the legal standard for such stops. In Seattle, these stops are subject to both federal and local regulations, and there has been considerable debate over their impact on communities, particularly concerning concerns about racial profiling and civil liberties. Efforts to refine and improve the practice focus on balancing effective policing with the protection of individual rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine if there is a racial disparity in the Seattle Terry Stops\n",
    "* Do the differences in races between the officer and the subject play a role in frisks arrests?\n",
    "* Determine the most common outcome of the Seattle Terry Stops and what it means\n",
    "* Develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an arrest occurring during a Terry Stop\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be divided into three workbooks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the process. We will start by exploring the data and cleaning, followed by followed by exploratory analysis aiming to addressing the first three objectives which are racial disparity during Terry Stops, role of race in the Terry Stops and the most common outcome of the Terry Stops in Seattle. We will then move on to the third workbook where we will be addressing the fourth objective of developing a comprehensive predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an arrest following a Terry Stop based on various factors.\n",

    "In this project we will be using the data obtained from City of Seattle on https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Terry-Stops."
